# Data-Structures-in-C

  ## The core things to know about the data structures:
  
    1. What is this Data structure?
    2. How does that work Internally?
    3. Why does this DS came into existence?
    4. When to use this?
    5. When not to use this DS?
    
  ## Common Opeartions in Data Structure:
  
    1. Insertion
    2. Deletion
    3. Accessing
    4. Searching
    5. Sorting
    6. Merging
    7. Maximum Element
    8. Minimum Element
